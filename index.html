                General
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                <p>The role of the Project Manager in JTI is to ensure that projects are delivered smoothly on-time and on-budget with minimal unexpected stoppages and risk in work.</p>
                <p>Imagine that you are the client who requested service from Join.To.IT. Would you like to know what has been done so far on your project? Would you like to see updates on a server and don’t have any issues? Would you like to pay for a great job and give us more and more projects if you are satisfied with our service? I believe, yes.</p>
                <p>Imagine that you are a developer managed by a PM. Would you like to get clear tasks and see feedback on each completed milestone? Would you like to get answers on your questions ASAP? Again, yes.</p>
                <p>Project Manager is something like a filter between a client and developers in order to get tasks, describe them and provide to developers. Also, PM is a filter on the other side, when a project is going to be shown to a client, PM should take a look on completed tasks and give to a client only those things that are done accordingly to requirements.</p>
                <p>You are not the only person who is interested in the realization of a project, but in order to get the project done, you should become the one who is most interested in that. Neither developers nor clients owe you anything. You should be the one who is supposed to beat the crap out them to finish a project. Developers are able to ignore you, but you should make them bring you the result. Clients also may ignore your requests but you have to get a project done so exploit them as they are your employees. You should complete the project at any effort.

                Trello is a great tool dedicated to making project management easier. It allows to quickly understand what is the status of the project, every team member knows what he/she is supposed to do. Trello is based on principles of Kanban and it is very easy to use. In “Details” there is a description of what columns we have in JTI to manage projects and each column has description of what content it should consist of.

                Details
              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">
                <p>Each Trello board should contain the following columns:</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic">Take into consideration if you want to add some column needed for your job - you are free to do that, but columns listed below are a must.</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><b>Backlog</b> - here we store cards are postponed to next sprints.</li>
                    <li><b>Sprint</b> <i>(2 weeks or 1 week, depends on a project)</i> -  after the creation of a sprint with a team you have to move cards from <u>Backlog</u> or <u>Need to Fix</u> to this column. Before starting of Sprint you have to fill all related requirements to the card so a developer will know the exact task.</li>
                    <li><b>In process</b> - once a developer starts work on some task, he has to take a card from <u>Sprint</u> in this column.</li>
                    <li><b>Review by PM</b> - after completion of a task a developer is supposed to move the card from <u>In Process</u> here. As soon as possible you have to review cards from here and move them to the next column or back to Sprint if it is not done accordingly to requirements and describe what is wrong.</li>
                    <li><b>Preparation for QA</b> - after successful review you are able to store completed tasks in this column and once it will make sense to test the scope of milestones - move them from here to the next column.</li>
                    <li><b>Ready for QA</b> - here should be only tasks reviewed by you as Project Manager, with full and actual requirements, deployed to test server and ready for QA engineers to check everything deeply. </li>
                    <li><b>Testing in Process</b> - QA engineers will take cards from Ready for QA and move them here when they are testing those cards. Depends on the result of testing they will move cards in the next two columns.</li>
                    <li><b>Need to fix</b> - in case if functionality related to a card works not correctly, the card will be moved here by QA engineers.</li>
                    <li><b>Ready for Acceptance Testing</b> - here QA engineers put cards that have been tested out and the verdict is positive (functionality works according to requirements) and once the whole project cards will be here - it is time to test the whole project (acceptance testing).</li>
                    <li><b>Confirmed by QA</b> - after acceptance testing cards will be moved here in case of positive results of testing. Otherwise, cards will be moved to Need to Fix and once the whole project is debugged, it will be needed to make one more session of acceptance testing and we will have as many iterations as needed in order to have zero bugs on the project.</li>

                Redmine is a good tool in order to manage projects at all, but we use it as bug-tracker.

                <p><b>Creation of a Project</b></p>
                <p> Depends on a type of a project there are three ways of creating the project in Redmine:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Web application</li>
                    <li>Mobile application</li>
                    <li>API</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a project consists of multiple types of projects listed above then you should create 1 parent project and 1 or 2 subprojects. For example, a project consists of web application, mobile app and api for mobile application and the main part is a mobile app. Anyway we count web project as main one so you have to create parent project with settings of web app projects and two subprojects, one for API and one for mobile application with related settings. Settings for each type are described below.

                <p><i><u>Documents</i></u> - here you are supposed to add all documents related to a project, add links to all servers and credentials for test users, links to prototype, workflow model, history of builds, design files etc.</p>

                <p><b>Trackers</b></p>
                <p><i><u>Bug</i></u> - it is tracker where issues are created by QA engineers, bugs can be assigned to developers in order to have them fix assigned issues; to PM in case to clarify requirements; to client in order to get his reply.</p>
                <p><i><u>Ticket</i></u> - it is a tracker for clients, they can create issues only in this tracker.</p>

                <ol>
                  <li><b>New</b> - all issues once created should have this status in case if it is not a pending question, then the issue should have status <u>Waiting for response</u>.</li>
                  <li><b>In Progress</b> - if the issue take much time (more than 1hr) to be fixed a developer has to put this status during fixing it.</li>
                  <li><b>Waiting for response</b> - if there are any questions that require answers, the issue should be created with this status or if someone needs additional information in order to resolve the issue he/she is able to put this status and assign it to a person who is capable of giving an answer.</li>
                  <li><b>Resolved</b> - after a developer get the issue fixed he is supposed to put this status and assign to person who has to check it.</li>
                  <li><b>Duplicate</b> - if there is another same issue team member should put this status and add link to related issue that has been duplicated and reassign back to creator or needed person.</li>
                  <li><b>Not a bug</b> - if the issue is not a bug, a developer should put this status, explain why and assign to PM. Then PM have to confirm it and assign the issue to QA or not confirm, assign responsible developer and explain why.</li>
                  <li><b>Additional Work</b> - if the issue is not a bug but by your opinion, it would be great to implement the feature, use this status and assign to a client to get his approval.</li>
                  <li><b>Re-open</b> - if you or QA checked resolved issue and it is not fixed properly, this status is used, the number of re-opens of the issue should be increased by 1 (there is such a field in Redmine) and responsible developer should be assigned back to it.</li>
                  <li><b>Confirmed by QA</b> - once QA has tested resolved issue and it is fixed - he will put this status.</li>
                  <li><b>Closed</b> - once you have checked an issue from trackers Review or Ticket and it is resolved - put this status.</li>

                There are two types of projects that we develop: web and mobile applications. API is optional and it is possible to have them in both types or also it is possible to not develop API at all. There are some differences in preparational steps so we have created two separate checklists.
                <br>Depends on a type of a project, go to the following links and copy needed list. If the project consists of both web and mobile application then combine both documents.

                You will be asked to get some projects estimated. There are two options: rough estimate and precise estimate. A task of Project Manager is to assign related developers and it is preferred to ask developers that are supposed to work on the project they estimate.

              <p class="card-text">
                Usually, rough estimates are for projects where we don’t know the exact requirements and client just wants to know the approximate price for his project. It is better to have big tasks here from 16 to 80 hours.
                <br>Precise estimates are for cases when we know exact requirements or at least detailed description. Tasks should be from 1 to 16 hours, as smaller hours per tasks as better.
                <br>
                <br>After getting an estimate from developers it is required to get approval from COO or if it is not possible then from CEO or CTO. They will check the adequacy of estimation and create an estimate for the client depends on the hourly rate of developers and the hourly rate of the client.
                <br>
                <br>Developers’ estimates are only for developers and they should be located in GDrive:
                <br><code>7. Project Files/[Current year]/[Current month]/[Project Name]</code></p>
                Clients estimates are located in another folder:
                <br><p><code>10. Project Files for Clients/[Current year]/[Current month]/[Project Name]</code></p>
                Clients should not know about devs’ estimate and devs should not know about the client's estimate.

                For each project, it should be either offline meeting with a WHOLE team of developers or call via Skype/Zoom/etc. PM has to create table with planned tasks and add related to sprint cards to Trello in column Sprint. Adding cards to Trello w/o meeting with a team will not be treated as completed Sprint. Meeting must be 20-40 minutes, no longer. On a meeting preferable to present also COO and CTO/CEO if you feel that you have serious issues on a project. Manage this risk yourself.

                Sprint is 2 business weeks (though can differ, depending on a project and client requirements). Every week is 40 hours. So one developer should work 80 hours during all sprint.
                <br>
                <br>We understand that developers can’t do coding all 80 hours, that’s why we give such a plan:
                <br>~ 80% of time dev does coding
                <br>~ 15% of time dev fixes bugs
                <br>~ 5% of time goes for stand-up meetings, discussions, participation in interview etc.
                <br>
                <br>In numbers devs will spend during sprint:
                <br>~ 64 hours for coding (80%)
                <br>~ 12 hours for fixing bugs
                <br>~ 4 hours for stand-up meetings, discussions etc.
                <br>Proportions can slightly change from time to time
                <br>
                <br>In numbers during the day you will spend:
                <br>~ 6.4 hours for coding (80%)
                <br>~ 1.2 hours for fixing bugs
                <br>~ 0.4 hours for stand-up meetings, discussions etc.
                <br>Proportions can slightly change from time to time
                <br>
                <br>The task of project manager is to oversee that team is completing tasks due to date and the sprint is still achievable. In the end of the first week it is needed to make a check-point meeting where should be at least one top-manager (CEO/CTO/COO) and project team. If the sprint is shorter and equals 1 week - do your checkpoint on Wednesday mornings.  There you are supposed to present what tasks has been planned to be completed, actual completed tasks and reasons why we do it slower or faster if it is the case.
                <br>
                <br>At the end of the last sprint week it is required to make retrospective meeting of whole sprint and basically discuss the same questions that on the first week meeting and also create sprint for next 2 weeks.

              <p class="card-text">
                <ol>
                  <li>Look at the video where our colleagues from IBM Agile Academy show an example of a good way of holding stand-ups</li>

                  <li>At the end of the meeting, you have an opportunity to energize team members before they return to work. Share a good natured joke, a motivational quote, or even come up with your own signature sign-off.</li>
                  <li>Stick to these three questions:
                    <ul>
                      <li>What has a recently accomplished?</li>
                      <li>What are my in-progress tasks and/or plans?</li>
                      <li>What obstacles are impeding my progress?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Stay Focused. Every stand-up needs a leader. The person who facilitates the stand-up must balance time-awareness and flexibility.</li>

              <p>Unfortunately, this case is a common one so you should be prepared.

                QA is one of the most important processes in the development of any project. According to Wikipedia’s quality assurance definition, it’s “a way of preventing mistakes or defects in manufactured products and avoiding problems when delivering solutions or services to customers.” There’s more to QA than this, however. Here are just a few of the numerous benefits a QA team can bring:
                <ul>
                  <li>QA teams help meet clients’ demands and expectations most fully</li>
                  <li>They build trust with customers and beat the competition in the long run by producing a better product</li>
                  <li>They save costs by detecting and fixing issues and flaws early in development</li>
                  <li>They assist in setting and maintaining high quality standards and shift focus from detecting issues to their prevention</li>
                </ul>

                    Depends on the readiness of project documentation there are two ways:
                    <ul>
                      <li>In case if there is no documentation at all or the documentation is not enough detalized - you should fill requirements in each card that will fully describe how the functionality related to the card is supposed to work.</li>
                      <li>In case if we have good documentation - just put in each card link to related page in documentation.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Make sure that correct developer(s) are assigned to cards you are going to give to QA.</li>
                  <li>Add URL link to server in each card with related functionality so QA will know exactly where to find the functionality.</li>
                  <li>Add comment “Reviewed by PM” in each card just to know that you have been reviewing the functionality.</li>

                Project Manager is supposed to do the following steps:
                <ol>
                  <li>If there is no project that we were working on the current week, you should add one more line to the table considering the correct format and create new weekly table kind of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vg58OoCU7PweIpuAwy619K2zS3G3l-ppgJwj3SX4c0w"><u>this one</u></a>;</li>
                  <li>If there is a project, open the link of previous weekly report and copy it in the same folder “Harvests” and enable the option “Share it with same people”;</li>
                  <li>Name the table as “<code>[Project name] (Week [week #] - [year])</code>”, e.g. “<code>Everworks ERP (Week 31 - 2019)</code>”;</li>
                  <li>Fill tasks that are done and the client can review on the server (or on the build if that the task is related to the mobile application) from 10 folders (important!);</li>
                  <li>Make sure that the client has access to the table. Give him direct access for commenting via email. Tables should not be shared as <b>“Anyone with the link can view”</b>;</li>
                  <li>Put total hours from the table and input it in general Harvest table in column “Hours”;</li>
                  <li>In the end, all your projects should be filled in. If there is nothing to get paid for you should fill in zero hours. Filled Harvest looks like <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V176AVjDEv65-ajZHoARtwiRR_qoJVjkbcj0xAUPL1Q"><u>this</u></a>.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It is preferable that all information has to be submitted by the end of Friday of the reporting week.

                Every week on Friday COO and QA Lead plan work of QA department. On Thursday or Friday Planning QA Meeting takes place. There Project Managers discuss with COO what projects and milestones they are going to give to QA next week.
                <br>Project Managers are supposed to prepare the following things what means that you are ready for the meeting:
                <ol>
                  <li>List of projects that are necessary to test out on the next week;</li>
                  <li>Approximate time of testing (you should discuss it with QA Lead and QA engineer who is supposed to test the project before);</li>
                  <li>List of projects that are not necessary to test yet, but it is possible to do that;</li>
                  <li>Cards in Trello for both types of projects should be marked with the label “wk[week#]” where [week#] is the number of the next week e.g. “wk31”;</li>
                  <li>Pay attention that if you say that on Wednesday 10 AM you will transfer to QA project X with cards A, B, C - you will have to do that or if it is not possible because of an acceptable reason, you have to warn COO and QA Lead in advance (at least 24 hours) so it will be possible to transfer another project to QA.</li>

                Risk management is a very complicated subject and you have to learn some material yourself but there are basic actions that will help you prevent many issues in the future.
                <ol>
                  <li>When you gave a developer any task there is a sense to check what is the status in the midday. It may help you to detect problems much earlier. Usually, developers struggling to solve complicated problems themselves but sometimes they are not capable of. But if you find it out, you will be able to ask for the assistance of other developers or CTO in the worst case.</li><br>
                  <li>You should always check that your developers have tasks at least for the next 2 weeks. In case if not you will have enough time to prepare documentation, estimate tasks and get approval from client or give developer to another PM but this is not preferable. Always let COO know about such kind of situations.</li><br>
                  <li>Track how the development team goes through the set sprint. In the case of 2 weeks sprint, on Friday of 1st week, 50% of tasks should be done. Is it true? If yes, no worries. If no - you will know that there is a problem and have a chance to solve it.</li><br>
                  <li>You promised to prepare scope of milestones for QA session but it seems like you will not be able to do that in-time or if full scope? Shit happens, but let QA Lead know about this, together you will find a way from the situation.</li><br>
